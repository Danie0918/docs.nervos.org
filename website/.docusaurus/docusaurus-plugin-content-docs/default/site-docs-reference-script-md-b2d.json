  "description": "If you are used to blockchains like Ethereum, you will recognize that CKB leverages a drastically different verification model: instead of creating a transaction that alters blockchain state when executing, a transaction in CKB contains state transitions directly in the form of cells. To alter the state of an existing cell, one just destroys the original cell, then create a new one in a single, atomic transaction. CKB scripts, running on CKB VM, actually perform series of validation rules on the input cells and output cells of the transaction.",
