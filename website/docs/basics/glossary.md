## Economic Glossary

### Base Issuance
A subsidy paid to miners in CKBytes for providing the compute requirements required for processing transactions on Nervos.

Base Issuance is paid for by using a fixed and decreasing inflation schedule. Approximately every four years the amount is halved until eventually stopping when the cap of 33.6 billion CKBytes have been issued.

#### See Also
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Secondary Issuance](#secondary-issuance)

- [Crypto-Economics RFC on Nervos Network GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md)

---

### Heavy Asset Problem
A common problem found in multi-asset blockchain platforms where the value of the assets stored on the chain gains significant value but the native token of the chain does not. This raises the incentive to attack the the network, but does not increase the security because the value of the native token is what is used to secure the network.

#### See Also
- [Asset](#asset)

---

### Liquidity
The ability for an asset to be bought or sold easily without causing a significant change in the current market price.

---

### Secondary Issuance
A method of continuously paying miners for the preservation of state data contained on the blockchain.

Secondary Issuance follows a fixed inflation schedule of 1.344 billion CKBytes per year. This amount does not change. Unlike Base Issuance, Secondary Issuance does not affect everyone on the network. It is a small and targeted inflation from users that occupy space on Nervos or hold their CKBytes outside of the Nervos DAO.

### State Rent
A recurring fee that is paid to persist and secure state data.

On Nervos, Secondary Issuance is used to facilitate the paying of State Rent by the users who occupy the space on the Nervos blockchain.

### Store of Assets
A platform which is designed to safely preserve multiple types of assets, each of which could be a store of value.

#### See Also
- [Store of Value](#store-of-value)

---

### Store of Value
An asset that is purchased to retain purchasing power in the long-term.

A good store of value either match or outpace the inflation rate of fiat currency, and has a reasonable amount of liquidity, allowing the asset to be easily sold.

#### See Also
- [Store of Assets](#store-of-assets)
- [Liquidity](#liquidity)

---

### Targeted Inflation
A form of inflation that only affects a specific subset of users.

Nervos uses Secondary Issuance to create targeted inflation on users who occupy space on the Nervos blockchain to pay State Rent. Long-term holders of CKBytes have the option of locking them in the Nervos DAO, which acts and an inflation shelter.
