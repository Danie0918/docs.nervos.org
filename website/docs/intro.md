title: Nervos CKB docs overview
---
This page is the top level entry point into the Nervos CKB documentation.

Nervos CKB is a public permissionless blockchain and the layer 1 of Nervos. CKB generates trust and extends this trust to upper layers, making Nervos a trust network. It's also the value store of the Nervos network, providing public, secure and censorship-resistant custody services for assets, identities and other common knowledge created in the network.We will also vigorously develop the developer community  and aim to offer blockchain developers exciting new capabilities. 

Now we are excited to introduce three projects: 

* [Lumos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/lumos)：Lumos is a full featured JavaScript/TypeScript based dapp framework for Nervos CKB and target Electron and Web platforms.
* [Capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule)：Capsule is a set of tools for Rust developers to develop scripts on CKB which covers the entire lifecycle of script development: writing、debugging、testing and deployment. We aim to improve the development experience of Rust developers.
* [Polyjuice](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/polyjuice)：Polyjuice is a layer 2 solution that provides a Web3 compatible interface on top of Nervos CKB. The design goal here is 95%+ compatible with existing Ethereum solution, so that your Solidity smart contracts and tools for Ethereum could work directly on top of Nervos CKB, while enjoying the following benefits:
    * A state rent model that everyone needs to pay for their own storage
    * An EVM that could be upgraded with new features without hardforks
    * A modern blockchain that does not suffer from Ethereum's legacies.
