---

This is the official documentation site for the Nervos Blockchain. Here you will find reference and learning materials for all audiences on both technical and non-technical topics.

## Newest Additions

We are excited to introduce three projects:

* [Lumos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/lumos)：Lumos is a full featured JavaScript/TypeScript based dapp framework for Nervos CKB and target Electron and Web platforms.
* [Capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule)：Capsule is a set of tools for Rust developers to develop scripts on CKB which covers the entire lifecycle of script development: writing,debugging,testing and deployment. We aim to improve the development experience of Rust developers.
* [Polyjuice](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/polyjuice)：Polyjuice is a layer 2 solution that provides a Web3 compatible interface on top of Nervos CKB. The design goal here is 95%+ compatible with existing Ethereum solution, so that your Solidity smart contracts and tools for Ethereum could work directly on top of Nervos CKB, while enjoying the following benefits:
    * A state rent model that everyone needs to pay for their own storage
    * An EVM that could be upgraded with new features without hardforks
    * A modern blockchain that does not suffer from Ethereum's legacies.

## Next steps
